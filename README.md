# Bentham Voice API

## Overview

Bentham Voice API is a sophisticated voice agent system designed for a legal tech startup called Bentham. The system aims to automate legal tasks by providing an AI-powered voice interface that can act as a lawyer, interact with clients, provide consultations, and take necessary actions.

## Purpose

This API serves as the backbone for Bentham's voice-based legal assistant, enabling natural conversations between clients and an AI legal advisor. The system is designed to handle complex legal queries, provide guidance, and automate routine legal tasks through voice interaction.

## Architecture

The Bentham Voice API is built on AWS services with a Java-based backend, leveraging the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Speech-to-Text (STT)** - Amazon Transcribe
   - Converts client speech to text in real-time
   - Supports streaming transcription for natural conversation flow

2. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) & Dialogue Management**
   - Amazon Bedrock with LLM models for advanced understanding
   - Context-aware conversation handling
   - Legal domain-specific knowledge processing

3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** - Amazon Polly
   - Converts AI responses to natural-sounding speech
   - Uses neural voices for lifelike interaction

4. **Voice Interface**
   - Handles microphone input and speaker output
   - Manages conversation flow and turn-taking

### Technical Stack

- **Backend**: Java 17+
- **Build System**: Gradle
- **Framework**: Spring Boot
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: AWS
- **APIs**: AWS SDK v2
- **Audio Processing**: Java Sound API
